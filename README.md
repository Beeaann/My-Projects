**Projects**
1. RAS Negotiator
Description: The RAS Negotiator is a specialized calculator employed by the law firm RAS LaVrar and developed using Python with customtkinter. Designed for their call center operations, this tool plays a crucial role in formulating personalized debt payment plans. By inputting caller account details, the program generates a comprehensive table outlining the payment schedule. This table includes essential information such as payment dates, initial and final payment amounts, optional down payment figures, and caller identification. The RAS Negotiator empowers the call center to craft effective and manageable payment arrangements for individuals seeking to settle their debts.

4. AM Accounting Process
The AM Accounting Process, developed specifically for the law firm Ras LaVrar, is a Python program using Pandas that dramatically accelerates the processing of Excel files for accounting purposes. With this powerful tool, what used to take an arduous 1.5 to 2.5 hours per week can now be accomplished in less than a minute. By automating tasks such as copying and renaming sheets, removing specific rows, reordering data, splitting client names, and generating pivot tables, the program eliminates the need for manual effort and expedites the entire process. With its exceptional speed and efficiency, the AM Accounting Process revolutionizes Excel data processing, allowing users at Ras LaVrar to save valuable time and focus on more critical aspects of their work.

5. PM Accounting Process
The PM Accounting Process, powered by the Pandas Python library, revolutionizes Excel file processing for accounting purposes. Previously, the task of processing each Excel file would consume 20-30 minutes. However, with this advanced program, the same task can now be completed in just a few seconds. The PM Accounting Process automates various operations, such as copying and renaming sheets, removing specific rows based on transaction methods, reordering data, and splitting client names. It also generates informative pivot tables for payment count review and balance analysis. By leveraging the efficiency and capabilities of Pandas, the PM Accounting Process eliminates manual effort and expedites the entire process, allowing users to achieve remarkable time savings and accomplish their accounting tasks with exceptional speed and accuracy.

6. Suit Packager
The SuitPackager simplifies the process of creating suit packages by automating various steps. In the previous process, the user had to manually open folder directories, move PDFs to a temporary working folder, run a merge script for account-based file combination (excluding WID PDFs), separately merge WID PDFs, and finally use the "SplitmergeV3" program to merge WID PDFs with corresponding suit packages. This process took an estimated 15 minutes per 1270 files, requiring 4 days a week for a total of 1 hour.

With the updated process, the user simply gathers the WID, NMC, STM, TNC, and AFF PDFs and places them in a temporary working folder. They then run the Suit Packager program, which automates the merging and packaging of the files. The program completes the task in just 1 minute for 1270 files, providing a significantly faster and more efficient solution for creating suit packages. This time-saving enhancement allows users to accomplish their tasks with increased productivity and reduced effort.
